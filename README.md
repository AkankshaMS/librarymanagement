# librarymanagement

A simple library manageent system which handles a simple functioning of a library. The system keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, their costs and other complete details. The admin, who takes care of all the above activities finds this automated system easy rather than using the manual writing system. All this data is stored in the database safely.
Also, PHP is used to design the user interface of the software with two different sets of users, one is admin and the other set of users are students. The admin is responsible for all the issues, addition of books, authors, categories, etc. Whereas the Student can login into his/her account and check the books borrowed by him or update any details, if required.
